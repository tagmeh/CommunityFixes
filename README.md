# CommunityFixes
A World of Warcraft addon built to fix some of the issues with the Communities feature.

Version 1.0.0

Implements a solution for when, on a fresh login/relog, the Community channel is assigned a chat number (eg /4), but text sent to that channel doesn't show up in the chat box or the Community chat until the user manually uhchecks/checks a chatbox setting.
